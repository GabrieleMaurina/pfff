To install pfff under Windows, you must first install Cygwin (see https://www.cygwin.com/).

Then, install a few cygwin packages:
 - autoconf (needed to install from source many opam packages)
 - automake
 - xinit (which will put lots of other dependencies)
 - lablgtk2-devel (which will pull lots of other dependencies)
 - cairo
 - opam

Once opam is installed, you will need to install a compatible
version of OCaml and a few OCaml packages:
 - opam init
 - opam switch 4.02.3
 - opam install lablgtk2 ocamlgraph camlp4o

Right now the OPAM package for cairo does not compile so you will
need to use instead the 'battery-included' one under external/.

Then to run codemap or codegraph you will need to start the Cygwin/X server.
For example run startxwin in one window and in another window do:

  $ export DISPLAY=:0
  $ ./codemap.exe .
