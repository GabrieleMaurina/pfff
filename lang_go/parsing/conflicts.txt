* if header and loop body

Go allow if/for/switch/select to omit the parenthesis around
the conditional/iterator/... as in 

  if true { ... }

However, this forces the grammar to introduce a special token
for the left brace of the then body (called loop_body in the grammar).
TODO: why?

Thus, some LBRACE must be retagged as LBODY to maintain a simple
unambiguous grammar. This is currently done in parsing_hacks_go.ml
by using a braced view (see ast_fuzzy.ml) to easily match and find
the right '{' to retag (basically the one following an if/for/switch/select.
