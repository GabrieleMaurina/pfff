(* Parsing Java using an external parser (e.g., tree-sitter or babelfish).
 *
 * Right now, the conversion from JSON to the AST defined in ast_java.ml is
 * done manually, which is very tedious
 * given the size of the Java language and the number of constructs to handle.
 *
 * alternatives to hand-coded JSON reader:
 *  - for tree-sitter, process
 *    https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java/blob/master/grammar.js
 *    and try autogenerate the OCaml code that will read the JSON deriving
 *    from this grammar.
 *  - use atdgen https://github.com/ahrefs/atd
 *    (doc at https://atd.readthedocs.io/en/latest ) to
 *    define the JSON structure and let atdgen auto generate the JSON
 *    reader code.
 *  - use jsonpat: https://github.com/pikatchu/jsonpat to infer the
 *    JSON structure and then auto generate the JSON reader code?
 *  - autogenerate the code from babelfish and treesitter themselves given
 *    they have more knowledge about the structure of what they output.
